# Mushroom Clicker Game - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a **Roblox mushroom-clicking incremental game** where players collect spores from AI-controlled mushrooms that roam around their personal plots. The game features a sophisticated client-server architecture with data persistence, upgrades, offline earnings, and multiple currency systems.

### Core Game Concept
- **Genre**: Incremental/Clicker game with idle mechanics
- **Theme**: Mushroom farming and spore collection
- **Mechanics**: 
  - Players get assigned personal plots with roaming AI mushrooms
  - Mushrooms automatically spawn spores and gems over time
  - Players can click mushrooms to force spore spawning
  - Spores automatically fly to player when in collection range
  - Multiple upgrade systems for enhanced gameplay
  - Offline earnings system for idle progression

## Architecture Overview

### Client-Server Structure

#### Server Side (`ServerScriptService/GameCore/`)
- **Main.lua**: Core system orchestrator that initializes all services
- **Services/**: Business logic modules (7 services)
- **Utilities/**: Shared utility modules (Logger, SignalManager, Validator)

#### Client Side (`StarterGui/ClientCore/`)
- **ClientMain.lua**: Client-side system orchestrator
- **Services/**: Client-side service modules (8 services)

#### Shared Resources (`ReplicatedStorage/Shared/Modules/`)
- **Constants.lua**: Game configuration constants
- **Types.lua**: TypeScript-style type definitions
- **ClientLogger.lua**: Client-side logging utility

### Service Architecture Pattern

Both client and server use a **service-oriented architecture**:

1. **Initialization**: Main orchestrator initializes all services
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services are linked together with references
3. **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate via RemoteEvents/Functions
4. **Cleanup Management**: Proper cleanup on shutdown

## Testing Approach

### Test File
- **test_spore_system.lua**: Documents the spore save/load system logic
- **Simulation**: Tests the data flow without running in Roblox
- **Documentation**: Explains the system behavior step-by-step

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Individual service functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Service-to-service communication
- **Data Persistence Testing**: Save/load cycles
- **Performance Testing**: Large player counts and data volumes

## Key Dependencies and Frameworks

### Roblox Services Used
- **DataStoreService**: Player data persistence
- **Players**: Player management and events
- **RunService**: Frame-by-frame updates and heartbeat events
- **TweenService**: Smooth animations for mushrooms and UI
- **CollectionService**: Object tagging system
- **ReplicatedStorage**: Shared data between client/server
- **Workspace**: 3D world object management

### Custom Frameworks
- **Service Architecture**: Custom dependency injection and lifecycle
- **Signal System**: Event-driven communication between services
- **Validation Framework**: Type checking and data validation
- **Logging Framework**: Structured logging with multiple levels

## Security Considerations

### Client-Server Validation
- **Server Authority**: All game state changes validated server-side
- **Anti-Exploit**: Client data never trusted without verification
- **Rate Limiting**: Purchase requests validated for timing and cost
- **Distance Validation**: Mushroom clicks require proximity checking

### Data Protection
- **DataStore Security**: Proper error handling prevents data loss
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Currency Protection**: Server-side currency manipulation only
- **Plot Security**: Players can only interact with their own plots

## Performance Optimizations

### Client-Side
- **Efficient Rendering**: Collection radius uses single cylinder part
- **Smart Updates**: UI only updates when values change
- **Connection Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Animation Optimization**: Reuse of tween objects where possible

### Server-Side
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple data operations combined when possible
- **Smart Saving**: Only save when data actually changes
- **Memory Management**: Regular cleanup of unused objects
- **Event Optimization**: Minimal RemoteEvent usage for performance

This project demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of Roblox game development, showcasing enterprise-level architecture patterns, comprehensive data management, and polished user experience systems. The modular design makes it highly maintainable and extensible for future feature development.

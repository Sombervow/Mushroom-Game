      PURCHASE_FAIL = "rbxassetid://89567959268147",
      VOLUME = 0.6

## Implementation Flow

### Success Flow:
1. User clicks purchase button
2. Server validates purchase
3. **✅ Purchase succeeds** → Deduct currency → Apply upgrade
4. **🔊 Play success sound** (`rbxassetid://111122618487379`)
5. Fire tutorial events
6. Sync data to client

### Failure Flow:
1. User clicks purchase button
2. Server validates purchase
3. **❌ Purchase fails** → No currency deducted
4. **🔊 Play fail sound** (`rbxassetid://89567959268147`)
5. **💎 Prompt dev product** (Spore pack for spore purchases, Gem pack for gem purchases)

## Dev Product Configuration

**Note**: You'll need to set the actual dev product IDs in `_promptDevProduct()`:
```lua
-- Replace these with your actual dev product IDs
local SMALL_SPORE_PRODUCT_ID = 123456789 -- Your small spore pack ID
local SMALL_GEM_PRODUCT_ID = 987654321   -- Your small gem pack ID
```

## Sound Assets Used
- **Success Sound**: `rbxassetid://111122618487379`
- **Fail Sound**: `rbxassetid://89567959268147`
- **Volume**: 0.6 for all shop sounds
- **Mushroom Click**: Increased to 0.8 volume

## Result
- 🔊 **Louder mushroom clicks**
- 🎵 **Success sounds** on all purchases
- ❌ **Fail sounds** when can't afford
- 💰 **Smart dev product prompts** (spores for mushroom shop, gems for gem shop)

All sound effects are automatically cleaned up after playing to prevent memory leaks.
